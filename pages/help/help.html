            <h4 class="help-center-title">1. How does Randmizr Work?</h4>
            <div class="help-center-text">
                Randmizr is based on randomization across multiple variables such as food, gifts, etc‚Ä¶ There are no predefined results or presets of any kind. No one knows what the outcome could be, we abide by the rules of probability. This is all done with fun in mind and having a good time with family, friends and/or significant others. Please do not take the results seriously, but we do suggest - if you‚Äôre up for it - to take it as a challenge! Don‚Äôt forget to tag us if you do!

            <h4 class="help-center-title">2. How does Randmizr Plan Work?</h4>
            <div class="help-center-text">
                Are you tired of having the same plans everytime? Are you always coming up with the plan and just want a break? Then fear no more! Randmizr plan generates indoor, outdoor, food and beverage, as well as other fun ideas (as long as the bus contains more than 1 person) all within one tap away.
                <br><br>
                ‚Üí To start, simply put your name in the first field, set your country of choice (only Lebanon available at the moment) and add up to 10 participants (in the virtual bus) that will join you on the trip (add participants by typing their name, and then tap on the ‚Äú+‚Äù button. To remove them, simply tap the ‚Äúx‚Äù next to their names). When you‚Äôre done, tap on ‚Äúrandmiz‚Äù! Your results will show up shortly after the loading screen. If you did not like the results, you can always randomize again by tapping ‚Äúretry‚Äù.

            <div class="help-center-text">
                Randmizr Decision allows you to input up to 30 variables as choices you want to decide on, and up to 5 outcomes as results, then, by tapping ‚Äúrandmiz‚Äù, the algorithm will present said outcome depending on the number of variables you‚Äôve added.
                <br><br>
                So, for example, if you had to choose between 10 restaurants, you would add their names in the choices list, and - for example‚Äôs sake - you want 2 results to show, then, the algorithm will generate two random results out of the 10 restaurants.
